# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

As a new data analyst hire at PyBer, a ride sharing app company, we are performing an exploratory analysis on three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. We are trying to use this data to help provide better access and affordability for riders in underserved areas.

## Results

The results of the analysis are not surprising as it shows Urban having the highest number of rides and Rural having the lowest. At first glance, the Average Fare per Rider/Driver being higher in Rural areas seems unusual, but when taking into consideration how spread out the United States is outside of cities, it makes more sense. The distance between housing and businesses in Rural areas in the United States would explain why riders would end up paying more than city goers who have shorter distances to travel.

Looking at the graph, each city type's pattern would appear vastly different from each other with a few overlaps. There are some interesting things to take note of though:

- Both Urban and Suburban appear to trend upwards after what looks like a lull in profits during the winter months. Rural, however, trended downwards for a period before going up. 
- Even though each line on the graph has varying peaks and valleys, they all seem to be following a similar pattern, until April at least. There's a crescendo in the beginning with a peak at the end of February, then each line has at least a small peak right after. 
- Suburban and Rural's lines mirror each other after the big & small peaks from the beginning of March, but Urban's line is more volatile. 
- At about mid-April all of the lines have their own seemingly uncoordinated behavior patterns.

While all of the city types appear to follow a general trend, there are environmental conditions each is reacting to that yield unique behaviors on the graph. Rural is the most unpredictable of them all, with only two of its peaks lining up with the other lines. Suburban's line would suggest a cyclical usage of the ride share, but more data would be needed to confirm that. The mirrored relationship between Suburban and Rural from mid-March to mid-April would also be an interesting relationship to investigate. While Urban does follow the general pattern, it has far more peaks than the other city types. This may be due to various events that take place in the city that would result in people needing to use the ride share more. Suburban and Urban also share a peak in mid-March that is notably absent in rural. It could prove useful to find out why that is. 



## Summary

Based on the results, these are my three recommendations for the CEO:

1. Find a way to lower to cost of fares for Rural areas. People who live in Rural areas are more likely to be lower income, which is most likely why ride share is not used as much there as it is not an affordable option. 
2. Do more research into why the patterns on the graph are emerging for each city type and plan driver availability and fare rates around that. For example, one reason why there could have been so many peaks and valleys for Urban in March could be that there were a lot of large concerts happening during that time. If the company knows these types of events are coming up, they can ensure more drivers will be available and possibly offer discounts or special deals to encourage visitors to use their service. The company could even go as far as to partner with the events to increase the chances of event goers using the ride share service. 
3. There seems to be a general pattern all of the city types follow, with Suburban and Rural even mirroring each other for a short while. I believe it would be beneficial for the company to find out why that is. More research about the demographics of the users and the reasoning behind the shared peaks between the lines could help the company create more effective marketing strategies that would lead to increase profits.
