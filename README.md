# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

## Results

The results of the analysis are not suprising as it shows Urban having the highest number of rides and Rural having the lowest. At first glance, the Average Fare per Rider/Driver being higher in Rural areas seems unusual, but when taking into consideration how spread out the United States is outside of cities, it makes more sense. The distance between housing and businesses in Rural areas in the United States would explain why riders would end up paying more than city goers who have shorter distances to travel.

Looking at the graph, each city type's pattern would appear vastly different from each other with a few overlaps. There are some interesting things to take note of though:

- Both Urban and Suburban appear to trend upwards after what looks like a lull in profits durng the winter months. Rural, however, trended downwards for a period before going up. 
- Even though each line on the graph has varying peaks and valleys, they all seem to be following a similar pattern, until April at least. There's a crecendo in the beggining with a peak at the end of Feburary, then each line has at least a small peak right after. 
- Suburban and Rural's lines mirror each other after the big & small peaks from the beginning of March, but Urban's line is more volitile. 
- At about mid April all of the lines have their own seemingly uncoordinated behavior patterns.

While all of the city types appear to follow a general trend, there are environmetal conditions each is reacting to that yeild interesting behaviors on the graph. Rural is the most unpredictable of them all, with only two of its peaks lining up with the other lines. Suburban's line would suggest a cyclical usgae of the ride share, but more data would be needed to confirm that. The mirrored relationship between Suburban and Rural from mid-March to mid-April would also be an interesting relationship to investigate. While Urban does follow the general pattern, it has far more peaks than the other city types. This may be due to various events that take place in the city that would result in people needing to use the ride share more. Suburban and Urban also share a peak in mid-March that is notably absent in rural. It would be interesting to find out why that is.
